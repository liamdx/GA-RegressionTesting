# Regression Testing

Small application that uses a Genetic Algorithm and Hill-Climbing Algorithm to optimally order two data sets. 

  - Optimality defined as a higher APFD (Average Percentage of Fault Detecition)
  - Once results have been gatehred, program presents statistics on algorithm in form of plots.

### Libraries used

* [Python 3.4.x >] - Any python containing statistics will do
* [NumPy] - Used for aggregation of results when plotting

### Tools used
* [VS Code]
* [PyCharm]

### Installation

Requires [Python] v3.4.x and above to run.
Requires NumPy

### Use
Open Main.py and run.
